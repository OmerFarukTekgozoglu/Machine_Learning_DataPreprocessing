# Machine Learning Data Preprocessing

Data pre-processing is the first TODO thing if you want to use any kind of data to your ML algorithm. With this very simple code null values and categorical data types can handle.

## Installation

The top libraries which use for data preprocessing are numpy and pandas. There're many other libraries to manipulate data, so you're free to use another library to manipulate your data.

```
$ bash pip install numpy
```

```
$ bash pip install pandas
```

This should work, if you already have pandas or numpy but the library doesn't work properly, try this;

```
$ bash pip install -U numpy
```
(or pandas)

Also I assume that you already have pip installition on your Python development envoiremnt or virtual envoriment. 

## Usage
* Clone the all files to a folder.
* Open your favorite editor.
* Locate to the folder that you created just before
* Run the code.
